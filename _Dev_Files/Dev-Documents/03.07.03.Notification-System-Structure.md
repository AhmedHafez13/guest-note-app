## Guest Note App - Notification System Structure and Channel Registration

This document outlines the structure of the notification system and the process for creating and registering new notification channels.

**Core Components:**

1. **Notification Channel Interface (`NotificationChannel`):**
    - Defines the contract for sending notifications through different channels.
    - Requires implementing an asynchronous `sendNotification` method:

        ```ts
        interface NotificationChannel {
          sendNotification(title: string, message: string, options?: NotificationOptions): Promise<void>;
        }
        ```

        - **Parameters:**
            - `title`: The notification title (string).
            - `message`: The notification message content (string).
            - `options` (optional): Additional configuration specific to the channel (type: `NotificationOptions`).
        - **Return Type:**
            - `Promise<void>`: Indicates asynchronous nature of notification delivery.

2. **Notification Options Interface (`NotificationOptions`):**
    - Provides optional configuration details for specific notification channels:

        ```ts
        interface NotificationOptions {
          emailOptions?: { recipientEmails: string[] };
          webhookOptions?: { urls: string[] };
          socketsOptions?: { recipientIds: number[] };
        }
        ```

        - Each property corresponds to a notification channel:
            - `emailOptions`: Contains `recipientEmails` for email notifications.
            - `webhookOptions`: Holds `urls` for webhook notifications.
            - `socketsOptions`: Provides `recipientIds` for real-time socket notifications.

3. **Notification Service (Singleton):**
    - A centralized service instance following the singleton pattern.
    - Manages notification channels and broadcast functionality.

        ```ts
        class NotificationService {
          // ... (Singleton implementation details)

          registerChannels(channels: NotificationChannel[]): void {
            // Register multiple notification channels
          }

          async broadcastNotification(title: string, message: string, options?: NotificationOptions): Promise<void> {
            // Broadcast notification to all registered channels
          }
        }
        ```

        - `registerChannels(channels: NotificationChannel[]): void` - Registers an array of notification channels at once.
        - `broadcastNotification(title: string, message: string, options?: NotificationOptions): Promise<void>` - Broadcasts a notification to all registered channels asynchronously.

**Creating and Registering New Channels:**

1. **Implement the `NotificationChannel` Interface:**
    - Create a new class for the desired notification channel (e.g., `SMSNotificationChannel`).
    - Implement the `sendNotification` method within the new class, handling the logic for sending notifications through that specific channel (e.g., sending SMS messages using an SMS provider API).

2. **Register the New Channel:**
    - During application startup, or when needed, use the `NotificationService.registerChannels` method to register the newly created notification channel instance along with any existing channels.

**Example:**

```ts
// New SMSNotificationChannel class (example)
class SMSNotificationChannel implements NotificationChannel {
  async sendNotification(title: string, message: string, options?: NotificationOptions) {
    // Implement logic for sending SMS notifications using an SMS provider API
  }
}

// Registering channels at startup (example)
import { NotificationService, GeneralNotificationChannels } from './config/notifications.config';

const smsChannel = new SMSNotificationChannel();
NotificationService.registerChannels([...GeneralNotificationChannels, smsChannel]);
```

By following this structure, you can easily extend the notification system to support new communication channels without modifying existing code that utilizes the service for sending notifications.
