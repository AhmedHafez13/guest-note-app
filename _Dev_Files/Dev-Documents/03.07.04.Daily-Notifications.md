## Guest Note App - Daily User Note Stats Notification

This document outlines the implementation of the daily cron job that sends notifications to users with their latest note statistics, using `node-schedule`.

**Install `node-schedule`:**

   ```bash
   npm i node-schedule
   npm i @types/node-schedule --save-dev
   ```

**Components:**

1. **Daily Notification Service (`DailyNotificationService`):**
    * Takes an array of `UserStat` objects as input.
    * Loops through each `UserStat` object.
    * Formats a message string using `formatStatsMessage` (explained later).
    * Calls `EmailService.sendEmail` to send the formatted message as an email with the user's email address and subject "Daily Notes Stats".

2. **Formatting Message (`formatStatsMessage`):** (**Updated**)
    * You'll need to replace the placeholder comment with the actual implementation of `formatStatsMessage`. 
    * This function should take a `UserStat` object and optionally a `callToActionUrl` as arguments.
    * It should format a message string with user email, a list of note type counts (similar to previous examples), and optionally include a call to action link for viewing notes.

3. **Daily Notification Configuration (`DailyNotificationConfig`):**
    * Defines a static method `scheduleDailyNotifications` to schedule the notification job.
    * Uses `node-schedule` to schedule a cron job that runs daily at midnight (`0 0 * * *`).
    * Within the job:
        * Fetches user notes summary using `UserNotesRepository.getUsersNotesSummary`.
        * Transforms the summary into `UserStat` objects using `summarizeUserNotes`.
        * Calls `DailyNotificationService.sendDailyNoteStats` to send notifications based on the generated user statistics.

4. **Schedule Daily Notifications (`src/server.ts`):**
    * Imports `DailyNotificationConfig`.
    * Calls `DailyNotificationConfig.scheduleDailyNotifications` to initiate the cron job scheduling process.

**Implementation:**

1. **User Notes Summary:** The system retrieves a summary of user notes for the past 24 hours from the `UserNotesRepository`.
2. **User Stats Transformation:** The summary data is transformed into `UserStat` objects, which group note counts by type for each user.
3. **Notification Message Formatting:** An unimplemented `formatStatsMessage` function within the `Daily Notification Service` is responsible for creating personalized messages with user email, note type counts, and potentially a call to action link. (**You'll need to implement this function**)
4. **Email Sending:** The formatted message for each user is sent as an email notification using the `Email Service`.
5. **Scheduling:** A cron job is scheduled using `node-schedule` to run daily at midnight, triggering the entire notification process.
