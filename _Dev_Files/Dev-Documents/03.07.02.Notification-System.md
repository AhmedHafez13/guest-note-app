## Guest Note App - Notification System

This document provides a detailed explanation of the notification system implemented in the application. It offers a central mechanism for sending notifications through various channels and guarantees consistent notification handling across the application.

### Components:

1. **Notification Channels:**
    - Defined by the `NotificationChannel` interface.
    - Represent communication methods for delivering notifications (email, sockets, webhooks, etc.).
    - Implement the `sendNotification(title: string, message: string, options?: NotificationOptions): Promise<void>` method to handle sending notifications through the specific channel. This method should be asynchronous to indicate potential delays in sending the notification.
        - **Common Responsibilities:**
            - Formatting the notification content (title, message) according to the channel's requirements.
            - Handling any rate limiting or error scenarios associated with the channel.
            - Logging the notification delivery attempt for auditing purposes.
    - **Examples:**
        - `EmailNotificationChannel`: Implements logic for sending email notifications, including recipient email address handling, email content formatting, and utilizing an email service provider's API.
        - `SocketsNotificationChannel`: Handles sending real-time notifications through websockets, potentially involving user ID validation and message delivery to connected clients.
        - `WebhookNotificationChannel`: Implements logic for sending notifications via webhooks, including URL validation, constructing appropriate payloads, and making HTTP requests to the configured webhooks.

2. **Notification Options:**
    - Defined by the `NotificationOptions` interface.
    - Provide additional configuration specific to notification channels:
        - `emailOptions`: Contains an `recipientEmails` property holding an array of email addresses for email notifications.
        - `webhookOptions`: Includes a `urls` property containing an array of URLs for webhook notifications.
        - `socketsOptions`: Provides a `recipientIds` property holding an array of user IDs for real-time socket notifications.

3. **Notification Service (Singleton):**
    - A central service instance following the singleton pattern for managing notifications.
    - Provides methods for registering notification channels and broadcasting notifications.
        - `registerChannels(channels: NotificationChannel[]): void` - Registers multiple notification channels at once. This allows for adding new notification channels without modifying existing code that utilizes the service.
        - `broadcastNotification(title: string, message: string, options?: NotificationOptions): Promise<void>` - Broadcasts a notification to all registered channels. This method is asynchronous, reflecting the potential for delays while sending notifications through different channels.
    - Implementation should ensure thread safety for concurrent access to the service, especially in multi-threaded environments.

### Configuration:

- General notification channels are defined in `config/notifications.config.ts`. The configuration specifies the currently supported channels (e.g., email, sockets, webhooks) by creating instances of their corresponding notification channel classes and adding them to an array.
- New notification channels can be introduced by:
    - Extending the `NotificationChannel` interface to define channel-specific behavior.
    - Implementing the `sendNotification` method within the new channel class to handle sending notifications through that channel.
    - Registering the new notification channel instance during application startup using `NotificationService.registerChannels`.

### Usage:

- Notification service is initialized during server startup by registering the configured channels from `config/notifications.config.ts`.
- Applications can leverage the `NotificationService.broadcastNotification` method to send notifications.
    - Provide a title, message, and optional notification options depending on the desired channels.
        - If specific recipient targeting is required (e.g., socket notifications), include the `socketsOptions` property with `recipientIds`.
        - Similarly, for email or webhook notifications, provide the appropriate options (e.g., `emailOptions` or `webhookOptions`) with the necessary details.

### Example Usage:

```ts
// Send a socket notification to specific users when a new note is received.
await NotificationService.broadcastNotification(
  `${userData.username} sent you a new note`,
  note.message.substring(0, Math.max(20, note.message.length)),
  {
    socketsOptions: { recipientIds: recipientIds },
  }
);

// Send an email notification to all users about a system update.
await NotificationService.broadcastNotification(
  'System Update Notification',
  'A critical system update has been deployed. Please refresh your application.',
  {
    emailOptions: { recipientEmails: ['user1@example.com', 'user2@example.com'] },
  }
);
```

### Benefits:

- Centralized handling of notifications through various channels simplifies development and maintenance.
- Easy integration with new notification methods by implementing additional notification channels.
- Flexible configuration allows customization of notification delivery based on requirements.
- Singleton pattern guarantees a single instance
