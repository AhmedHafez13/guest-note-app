## User Stories for Guest Note App (Agile Paradigm)

Following the user story format of "As a [user role], I want [what you want to do] so that [benefit]," here are user stories for the Guest Note App requirements:

**User: Sender**

* **US-1:** As a sender, I want to create a note with a title, message, and recipient(s) so that I can send personalized messages to friends and guests.
* **US-2:** As a sender, I want to choose a type for my note (e.g., birthday wish, congratulations) so that the recipient understands the purpose of the message.
* **US-3:** As a sender, I want to attach media files (e.g., photos, videos) to my note (with size limitations) so that I can add a visual touch to my message. (Optional)

**User: Recipient**

* **US-4:** As a recipient, I want to receive instant notifications on my device whenever I get a new note  so that I'm always aware of new messages from friends and guests.
* **US-5:** As a recipient, I want to view my timeline of received notes within the last 30 days so that I can easily see all recent messages.
* **US-6:** As a recipient, I want to filter my timeline by note type(s) so that I can focus on specific categories of messages (e.g., birthdays, invitations).
* **US-7:** As a recipient, I want to navigate through pages of my timeline using pagination so that I can efficiently browse through a large number of notes.
* **US-8:** As a recipient, I want to soft delete notes I don't need anymore so that I can declutter my timeline without permanently removing them.

**User: All Users**

* **US-9:** As a user, I want to configure notification settings so that I can choose how I want to be notified about new notes (e.g., email, in-app notification). (Optional)
* **US-10:** As a user who has enabled daily stats notifications, I want to receive a daily summary of the types and number of notes I've received  so that I can stay updated on important messages without manually checking my timeline.

**These user stories cover the core functionalities outlined in the requirements. As development progresses, additional user stories can be added to incorporate new features or address specific user needs.**
