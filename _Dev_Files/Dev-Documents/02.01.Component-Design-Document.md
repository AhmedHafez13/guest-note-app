## Guest Note App - Component Design Document

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the component design for the Guest Note App, detailing the breakdown of functionalities into smaller, manageable modules. Each component's technical specifications are defined, including algorithms, data structures, and APIs for communication between components.

**2. System Components**

The following core components will be implemented for the Guest Note App:

* **User Management Component:**
    * Handles user registration, authentication, and authorization.
    * Stores user data securely in the database.
    * APIs:
        * `register(username, password)`
        * `login(username, password)`
        * `getUserProfile(userId)`
        * `updateUserProfile(userId, profileData)`
* **Note Management Component:**
    * Processes note creation, modification, and retrieval.
    * Validates note data and interacts with the database for storage and retrieval.
    * APIs:
        * `createNote(senderId, recipientIds, title, message, typeId, mediaFiles - optional)`
        * `getReceivedNotes(userId, fromDate, toDate, typeIds - optional)` (for timeline)
        * `deleteNote(userId, noteId)` (soft delete)
* **Note Type Management Component:**
    * Manages pre-defined note types.
    * APIs:
        * `getNoteTypes()`
        * `disableNoteType(typeId)`
        * `enableNoteType(typeId)`
* **Notification Management Component:**
    * Utilizes a messaging queue to handle asynchronous note creation notifications.
    * Interacts with a notification service to deliver real-time notifications.
    * APIs:
        * `publishNoteCreation(noteData)` (on note creation)
* **Notification Service Component:**
    * Subscribes to the messaging queue for new note creation messages.
    * Retrieves user data and notification preferences.
    * Integrates with a notification provider API to send notifications (email, push).
* **Daily Stats Generation Component (Optional):**
    * Generates daily reports with user note statistics by type.
    * Utilizes the messaging queue to send notification summaries.
    * APIs:
        * `generateDailyStats()` (scheduled task)

**4. Communication Between Components**

* User Management Component interacts with the database for user data storage and retrieval.
* Note Management Component interacts with User Management for sender/recipient information, the database for note storage and retrieval, and the Notification Management Component for sending note creation notifications.
* Note Type Management Component interacts with the database for note type storage and retrieval.
* Notification Management Component interacts with the messaging queue for publishing and receiving messages, and the Notification Service Component for sending notifications.
* Notification Service Component interacts with the database for user data retrieval and the notification provider API for delivering notifications.
* Daily Stats Generation Component interacts with the database for retrieving note data, the messaging queue for sending daily summary notifications, and potentially a separate reporting service for generating reports (depending on implementation).
