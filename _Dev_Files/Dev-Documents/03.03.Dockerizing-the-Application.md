## Guest Note App - Dockerizing the Application

This document outlines the process of containerizing the Guest Note App using Docker and Docker Compose.

**Prerequisites:**

* Docker and Docker Compose installed on system. You can download them from the official Docker website: [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/).
* A basic understanding of Docker concepts (images, containers, Dockerfile).

**Steps:**

1. **Create Dockerfile:**

* Development Version

    ```
    FROM node:20-alpine

    # Set working directory within the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy package.json and package-lock.json
    COPY package*.json ./

    # Install dependencies
    RUN npm install

    # Copy remaining project source code
    COPY . .

    # Expose the port on which the application listens
    EXPOSE 8080

    # Command to run the application
    CMD [ "npm", "run", "dev" ]
    ```

* Production version

    ```dockerfile
    # Use Node.js base image with a specific version
    FROM node:20-alpine AS builder

    # Set working directory within the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock)
    COPY package*.json ./

    # Install dependencies
    RUN npm ci --omit=dev

    # Copy remaining project source code
    COPY . .

    # Use a different image for the production environment
    FROM node:20-alpine

    # Set working directory
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy only the production dependencies and source code
    COPY package.json ./
    COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules /app/node_modules
    COPY . .

    # Expose the port on which the application listens
    EXPOSE 8080

    # Command to run the application 
    CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
    ```

1. **Create docker-compose.yml:**

    ```yaml
    version: '3.9'

    services:
      guest-note-app-database:
        image: mysql:8.0
        restart: always
        env_file:
          - .env
        volumes:
          - guest-note-app-db-data:/var/lib/mysql
        ports:
          - '3306:3306'

      guest-note-app-backend:
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: ${DOCKERFILE}
        volumes:
          - .:/app
        ports:
          - '8080:8080'
        environment:
          NODE_ENV: development
        env_file:
          - .env
        depends_on:
          - guest-note-app-database

    volumes:
      guest-note-app-db-data:
    ```

**Building and Running the Application:**

1. Build and run the Docker image using:

    ```bash
    docker compose build
    docker compose up
    ```

2. View Running Containers:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
