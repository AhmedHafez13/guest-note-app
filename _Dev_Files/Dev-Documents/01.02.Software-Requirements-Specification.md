## Guest Note App - Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

**1. Introduction**

This document specifies the software requirements for the Guest Note App, a mobile application that enables users to send and receive personalized notes with real-time notifications.

**2. System Overview**

The Guest Note App is a client-server application consisting of:

* **Client App:** TBD
* **Server:** Back-end logic for processing requests, managing data, and interacting with external services.
* **Database:** Stores user data, notes, types, and other application information.
* **Notification Service:** Delivers real-time notifications to users through chosen channels (e.g., email, push notifications).

**3. System Requirements**

**3.1 Functional Requirements**

**3.1.1 User Management:**

* Users can register and authenticate with the app.
* User accounts should be secured with proper password hashing and access control. User profile management for basic information (name, profile picture).

**3.1.2 Note Management:**

* Users can create notes with titles, messages, and a list of recipient user IDs.
* A selection of pre-defined note types should be available (e.g., birthday wish, congratulations).
* Users can optionally attach media files (photos, videos) to notes within a specified size limit.
* The system validates recipient user IDs and note type existence before creating a note.
* Users can view a timeline of their received notes within the last 30 days.
* Users can filter the timeline by one or more note types.
* The timeline displays note details (title, message, type, media files, created at).
* Pagination allows users to navigate through a large number of timeline notes.
* Users can soft delete notes from their timeline, marking them as deleted but not permanently removing them.

**3.1.3 Notification System:**

* Upon note creation, the server publishes a message to the messaging queue containing the note details and recipient user IDs.
* A separate notification service subscribes to the messaging queue and receives new note messages.
* The notification service retrieves recipient details and notification preferences from the user database.
* The service uses a notification provider API (e.g., Pushwoosh, Firebase Cloud Messaging) to send real-time notifications based on user preferences (e.g., email, in-app notification).
* Users can opt-in to receive daily summaries of their received notes categorized by type.
* The system generates daily reports with note statistics (number of notes per type) for users who enabled daily summaries.
* Daily reports are sent through the notification system using the messaging queue and notification service.

**3.2 Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Performance:** TBD
* **Scalability:** The system architecture should be scalable to accommodate a growing user base and message volume.
* **Security:** User data and communication should be protected with secure authentication, authorization, and data encryption techniques.
* **Usability:** TBD

**4. User Interfaces**

* **Client App:**
    * User registration and login screen.
    * Interface for creating new notes with title, message, recipient selection, note type selection, and optional media file attachment.
    * Timeline view to display received notes with filtering and pagination functionalities.
    * Option to configure notification preferences.
    * Ability to view and manage user profile information.

**5. System Interfaces**

* The client app communicates with the server API using secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS).
* The server API interacts with the database for data storage and retrieval operations.
* The notification service integrates with a notification provider API to deliver real-time notifications.

**6. Data Model**

The system will manage the following data entities:

* **User:** Stores user information (ID, username, password hash, profile data).
* **Note:** Stores note details (ID, title, message, type_id, recipient user IDs, media files, created_at, deleted_at - for soft delete).
* **NoteType:** Stores pre-defined note types (ID, name, disabled - flag for disabling types).

**7. Design Constraints**

* Media file attachments should have a reasonable size limit to ensure efficient storage and performance.

**8. Quality Attributes**

TBD

**9. Dependencies**

The Guest Note App relies on external dependencies including:

* A database management system (e.g., MySQL) for data storage.
* A notification provider API (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid, Pushwoosh, Firebase Cloud Messaging) for real-time notifications.
* Secure authentication and authorization libraries for user access control.

**10. Verification and Validation**

* **Unit testing** will be conducted to verify the functionality of individual software modules.
* **Integration testing** will ensure different system components work together seamlessly.
* **System testing** will validate the overall functionality of the Guest Note App against the specified requirements.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** TBD
